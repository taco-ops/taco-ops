Howdy! My name is David Perez.

My focus is on platform engineering and DevOps: Kubernetes clusters designed to recover from failure, pipelines that validate and deploy with confidence, and observability stacks that help us understand what’s really happening inside our infrastructure. I work with tools like GKE, EKS, k3s, Terraform, and Ansible. Prometheus, Thanos, Loki, and Grafana are the instruments I use to monitor the health and behavior of the systems I help design.

More recently, I’ve been working at the edges of AI and automation. I’ve built Python pipelines that process real-world image data, applying machine learning to problems like computer vision and astrophotography. One of my favorite projects involved removing satellites from deep-sky images, revealing galaxies as they appeared before we ever reached orbit.

What matters most to me is alignment between people, systems, and the purpose behind the work. Infrastructure isn’t just a set of tools. It’s a language we use to collaborate, to trust, and to build things that last.

The systems we design reflect the questions we’re trying to answer. I try to ask thoughtful ones, build with care, and leave behind tools that quietly support others in doing the same.
