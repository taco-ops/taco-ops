## ðŸ›  whoami

I'm an **Orchestrator of Cloud Systems**, weaving resilience and observability into the digital fabric that connects our world. My journey spans from rendering Marvel's cosmic battles at Disney Studios to architecting autonomous systems at Fox Robotics, and currently designing cloud-native infrastructure that scales across galaxies of compute at Silicon Labs.

By day, I work with **Kubernetes**, **Prometheus**, and the elegant dance of distributed systems, finding beauty in the patterns that emerge when infrastructure serves human creativity. By night, I turn my attention skyward, capturing photons that have traveled millions of years to reach my telescope: a reminder that we are all made of star-stuff, building with what we know.

I believe infrastructure should be like the cosmos itself: vast, resilient, and quietly magnificent, supporting the dreams we dare to build upon it.

## ðŸš€ Current Focus

**Senior DevOps Engineer at Silicon Labs** (2025 - present)  
Architecting cloud-native systems that scale to astronomical proportions. Specializing in:
- **Kubernetes orchestration** across multi-cloud environments
- **Observability platforms** with Prometheus, Thanos, Loki, and Grafana
- **GPU infrastructure automation** for AI/ML workloads
- **Platform engineering** that empowers development teams

## ðŸŒŸ Featured Projects

### [Seestar-MCP](https://github.com/taco-ops/seestar-mcp) - When Starlight Meets Intelligence
A Model Context Protocol server that bridges AI models with the ZWO Seestar telescope, enabling natural language control of deep space observations. Through reverse-engineered protocols and precise coordinate calculations, AI assistants can execute commands like "Start a 2x2 mosaic of the Orion Nebula" while handling telescope control, catalog lookups, and imaging workflows.

**ðŸ”§ Tech Stack:** Python â€¢ Docker â€¢ Model Context Protocol â€¢ Astronomical Catalogs â€¢ UDP/TCP Protocol Implementation

### [Nebulift](https://github.com/taco-ops/nebulift) - AI-Powered Astrophotography Quality Control
An intelligent image quality assessment system that automatically sorts astronomical images into clean, contaminated, and review categories. Combines traditional computer vision (streak detection, cloud analysis) with ResNet18 deep learning to filter out artifacts from telescope sessions. Features distributed Kubernetes training, CPU-optimized inference, and comprehensive FITS file processing.

**ðŸ”§ Tech Stack:** Python â€¢ PyTorch â€¢ Computer Vision â€¢ Kubernetes â€¢ Docker â€¢ FITS Processing â€¢ Distributed Training


## ðŸŒŒ Technical Philosophy

### The Cosmic Perspective of DevOps
My approach to infrastructure is influenced by the cosmic perspective: understanding that the systems we build mirror the elegant complexity of the universe itself. Just as galaxies maintain structure through gravitational forces, our distributed systems achieve stability through well-designed observability, automated recovery, and thoughtful architecture.

### Key Principles
- **ðŸ”­ Observability as Exploration**: Like telescopes aimed at distant galaxies, monitoring tools reveal hidden patterns in our systems
- **ðŸŒ€ Resilience Through Understanding**: Infrastructure should recover from failure with the same grace that cosmic systems self-organize  
- **âœ¨ Automation with Intent**: Technology should amplify human creativity, not replace human judgment
- **ðŸ›° Platform as Foundation**: Great infrastructure quietly enables remarkable work, like the cosmic background that supports all matter

**The Walt Disney Studios** (2022 - 2024)  
*Senior Site Reliability Engineer*  
Embedded with Marvel's post-production teams, built secure release pipelines for Marvel's Render Farm (95% deployment time reduction), and collaborated on AI/ML infrastructure for cutting-edge VFX workflows.

## ðŸŒ  Beyond the Terminal

When I'm not architecting cloud systems, I'm pointing telescopes toward distant galaxies, capturing light that has traveled for millions of years. This intersection of technology and cosmic wonder influences everything I build: seeking patterns in the vast complexity, finding beauty in elegant solutions, and remembering that we're all part of something infinitely larger.

My writing explores this connection between DevOps and the cosmos, finding metaphors in stellar evolution for system lifecycle management, and discovering that the best infrastructure, like the universe itself, is both incredibly complex and beautifully simple.
