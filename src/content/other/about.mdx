I'm an Orchestrator of Cloud Systems, weaving resilience and observability into the digital fabric that connects our world. My journey has taken me from rendering Marvel's cosmic battles at Disney Studios to giving voice to autonomous robots at Fox, and now to architecting cloud-native systems that scale across galaxies of compute at Silicon Labs.

By day, I work with Kubernetes, Prometheus, and the elegant dance of distributed systems, finding beauty in the patterns that emerge when infrastructure serves human creativity. By night, I turn my attention skyward, capturing photons that have traveled millions of years to reach my telescope, a reminder that we are all made of star-stuff, building with what we know.

I believe infrastructure should be like the cosmos itself: vast, resilient, and quietly magnificent, supporting the dreams we dare to build upon it.
