I'm a Custodian of Cloud Systems focused on resiliency, observability, and automation. I work with Kubernetes and cloud-native tools by day, and explore the night sky through astrophotography when time allows. I care about infrastructure that supports people, scales with clarity, and reflects the systems it serves.
