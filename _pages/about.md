I'm David Perez, a DevOps Engineer who crafts robust, reliable systems with one thing in mind: efficiency. Over a decade in the trenches, from Walt Disney Studios to high-growth startups, I've honed my skills with Kubernetes, Python, AWS, CI/CD, and Terraform. I speak the language of infrastructure and automation, building pipelines that hum and deployments that never blink.

At Disney, I wasn't battling Thanos, I was tackling slow pipelines. By implementing refined observability and best practices, I sliced their slowest release times by 95%. That's not magic, it's data-driven optimization.

Migrating Akido Labs to a secure cloud fortress wasn't about spells, it was about strategic planning and flawless execution. I unlocked the power of EKS Fargate while meeting HIPAA compliance head-on.

I'm no lone wolf. Whether collaborating with the Marvel team or mentoring junior engineers, I thrive on building effective partnerships. Open-source principles and continuous learning are my superpowers.
